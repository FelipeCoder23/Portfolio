# Bank Churn Prediction Project

This project delved into analyzing a pressing issue faced by financial institutions: customer churn. By examining a dataset representing various client profiles, the aim was to unearth the pivotal factors that contribute to a client's decision to leave a bank. Through this endeavor, we sought to construct and fine-tune the most effective machine learning model for predicting churn, thus equipping the bank with a strategic tool for improving client retention.

## Project Overview

The analysis was structured in three stages, each involving a different approach to data handling:

- **Code 1:** Analysis without any data preprocessing.
- **Code 2:** Data preprocessing applied solely to the training dataset.
- **Code 3:** Both training and test datasets undergo thorough cleaning and preprocessing.

Through these distinct codes, we aimed to evaluate the impact of data quality on model performance.

## Key Outcomes

The project's success was marked by the identification and optimization of the most robust machine learning model, which outshone its counterparts in accuracy and reliability. The refined model serves as a testament to the power of meticulous data analysis and machine learning in addressing real-world business challenges.
