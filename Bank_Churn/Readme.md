This project consisted of looking for a trend of abandonment of clients of a bank. The factors that have more weight when predicting which client will leave the bank were determined and the best ML model was found and optimized to predict this.
There are 3 different codes which differ in the following:

Code 1: No data processing is performed

code 2: data processing is performed only for training data.

code 3: training and test data are cleaned.
