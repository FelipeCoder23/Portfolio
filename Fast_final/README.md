# Handball Goal Scoring Analysis with AI

Welcome to the AI-powered goal detection project in handball matches. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques, this system streamlines the goal analysis in handball by identifying goal-scoring moments with impressive accuracy.

## Overview
The application of AI in sports analysis is still in its nascent stages, particularly in handball. This project aims to bridge that gap, offering a time-saving tool for sports analysts by automating the detection of scored goals.

## Technologies
- **YOLOv8**: For real-time goal detection.
- **DeepSORT**: For enhanced player and ball tracking.
- **FastAPI**: For a robust and efficient API.

## Development Process
- **Data Collection**: Manually gathered and labeled handball match clips to train the model.
- **Model Training**: Trained on an initial dataset of 3000 images, achieving 60-70% accuracy.
- **Integration and Testing**: The model was integrated into a backend framework ready for further development and testing.

## Results & Future Work
The system successfully demonstrated the capability to detect goals with significant accuracy, considerably cutting down manual analysis time. Future work involves improving the model with additional data and potentially exploring cloud deployment for easier access and scalability.
